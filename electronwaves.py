#  We currently 3/9/24 only simulate free electrons but the "displacement current" from bound electrons might be important
#  We can simulate electrons bound to atoms as electrons on a spring to a point.  So this would not be hard.
#  Can have an array of flags telling us which electrons are bound - electron_is_bound
#  And another array of atom_positions showing where the spring is connected to
#  This was maxwell's model and so almost certain to work for propagating waves
#  
# Gemini:
#     Electromagnetic waves like light interact much more strongly with bound electrons than typical electrical signals 
#     in a wire. This is the basis for how materials reflect, refract, and absorb light.
#  So to do light we expect to need to simulate bound electrons but we can easily do this I think.
#
# Visible light falls within a range of wavelengths from approximately 380 nanometers (nm) to about 750 nm. 
#    About 100 times the distance between air molecules!
#
# In the case of a large plate (where 'large' means that the plate's dimensions are much larger than the distance from the plate), 
# the electric field is approximately uniform close to the plate. This means that the field strength does not significantly decrease 
# for short distances (like centimeters) from the plate's center or surface. The uniformity of the field holds true as 
# long as the distance from the plate is small compared to the dimensions of the plate.
# 
# The diameter of a 22-gauge wire is approximately 2,510,234 copper atoms wide. 
#   Electrons in a wire are propagating a plane wave!  The field is pushing on
#   electrons thousands of atoms in front at the same time, so the wave can 
#   move far faster than any electron moves!
#
# Where the Voyager probes are there is about 1 atom per cubic cm.
# If a plane wave is miles wide, that could be enough to propagate.
#
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_analogy  - water and electricity similarity - but speed of light is plane wave!
#
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDlZ-aY9GN4   - a magnetic field in one frame can be an electric field in another -relativity
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TKSfAkWWN0   - veritasium on relativity and electric vs magnetic
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii7rgIQawko   - The Science Asylum on relativity and manetic vs electric
#     There are so many positive and negative charges that a slight length change in one can make significant net charge
#
#
# Would be amazing result of this theory if it could correctly show:
#  1- speed of light comes out right from plane wave and electrons charge and mass
#  2- light of certain frequencies can drive electrons off as in experiments
#  3- magnetic field from moving charges - if we can simulate moving charges curving in mag field using instant force beteen electrons
#  3b - if magnetic field type forces could emerge from delayed electrostatic forces that would be cool as well.  
#        chatbot.opinions has lots of chatbots that think this might work.
#  4 - ampiers law that two wires next to each othe with current going the same way attract and opposite then repel
#        delayed electrostatic forces could do this and so be a simple test of idea that magnetism is just delayed electrostatics
#        To do this we need to simulate 2 wires with currents
#
# At room temperature a ratio of 1 electron in 100,000 copper atoms is really free.
#   Same as saying only 0.001% or 10^-5 of the conduction electrons are free.

#  Update idea Feb 9, 2024
# In classical simulations, introducing a "hard sphere" collision model for very close distances could prevent physical 
#  impossibilities like electron overlap. This involves detecting when electrons are within a certain minimum distance of 
# each other and then calculating their trajectories post-collision based on conservation of momentum and energy, similar to billiard balls colliding.
#
#  In the wire display it may be good to show average movement of each dX in a graph.  Perhaps this will show
#  a much faster wave than what is probably a and "electron density wave".   Feb 12, 2024
#
# NEXT GOAL
#   2 wires with current in each and a way to measure force between them
